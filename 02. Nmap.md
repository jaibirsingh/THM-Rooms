* Every computer has a total of 65535 available ports; however, many of these are registered as standard ports.
* For example, a HTTP Webservice can nearly always be found on port 80 of the server. A HTTPS Webservice can be found on port 443. Windows NETBIOS can be found on port 139 and SMB can be found on port 445.
*  only port numbers 0 to 1023 are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known ports.
*  What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats at once?
  * -oA

* How would you tell nmap to scan all ports?
  * -p-
 
*  Configure a firewall to respond with a RST TCP packet. For example, in IPtables for Linux, a simple version of the command would be as follows:

* `iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport <port> -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset`

* This can make it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get an accurate reading of the target(s).

# Scan types
### TCP connect scans
* `-sT`
* ![image](https://github.com/jaibirsingh/THM-Rooms/assets/20526556/f7b51549-af8a-4a7f-b1f1-c56f9476d894)

**What are RFCs** 
 * In networking, RFCs are documents that describe various aspects of the internet, its protocols, technologies, and standards.
 * They are published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and serve as a means for individuals and groups to propose new standards, discuss protocols, or document best practices.

### SYN scans
* `-sS`
* SYN scans are sometimes referred to as "Half-open" scans, or "Stealth" scans.
* Where TCP scans perform a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server (this prevents the server from repeatedly trying to make the request).
* In other words, the sequence for scanning an open port looks like this:
* ![image](https://github.com/jaibirsingh/THM-Rooms/assets/20526556/c736b74f-facd-4646-9d95-72982ca4232a)
* All in all, the pros outweigh the cons.
* For this reason, SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap if run with sudo permissions. If run without sudo permissions, Nmap defaults to the TCP Connect scan we saw in the previous task.

### UDP scans
* `sU`
* When a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response.
* The request is sent a second time as a double-check. If there is still no response then the port is marked open|filtered and Nmap moves on.
* When a packet is sent to a closed UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable. This clearly identifies closed ports, which Nmap marks as such and moves on.
* UDP connection is slow, so scanning with  nmap -sU --top-ports 20 <target>. Will scan the top 20 most commonly used UDP ports, resulting in a much more acceptable scan time.

### Null scans
* `-sN`
*  the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all.
*  As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed.

### FIN scans
* `-sF`
* a request is sent with the FIN flag (usually used to gracefully close an active connection). Once again, Nmap expects a RST if the port is closed.

### Xmas scans
* `-sx`
* It's referred to as an xmas scan as the flags that it sets (PSH, URG and FIN) give it the appearance of a blinking christmas tree when viewed as a packet capture in Wireshark.

### Ping sweep OR ICMP network scanning
* `-sn`
* In this case, Nmap sends an ICMP packet to each possible IP address for the specified network. When it receives a response, it marks the IP address that responded as being alive.
* The -sn switch tells Nmap not to scan any ports -- forcing it to rely primarily on ICMP echo packets to identify targets.
* eg: `nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-254` OR `nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24`

## NSE scripts
* Nmap Scripting Engine --> Written in Lua programming language
* There are many categories available. Some useful categories include:
  * safe:- Won't affect the target
  * intrusive:- Not safe: likely to affect the target
  * vuln:- Scan for vulnerabilities
  * exploit:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
  * auth:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
  * brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
  * discovery:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).
### Where to look for the NSE scripts
* The first is the page on the Nmap website (mentioned in the previous task) which contains a list of all official scripts.
* The second is the local storage on your attacking machine. Nmap stores its scripts on Linux at /usr/share/nmap/scripts.
 * `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`
* All of the NSE scripts are stored in this directory by default -- this is where Nmap looks for scripts when you specify them.

* Advanced search:
 *  We can also grep through it to look for scripts. For example: `grep "ftp" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`
 *  The second way to search for scripts is quite simply to use the ls command.65E UNFWSUFVDSJVKFKGBFJJFIJFOHFGWFOWRHBGAWRYG0R=HU[JKRTJ]TLG[MLUKLM[ML'HMK PHJMK HN PNBK ;MNB ;NMG;LNJHPNDTFGBJNDPY 
 *  For example, we could get the same results as in the previous screenshot by using `ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*`
 *  The same techniques can also be used to search for categories of script. For example:
 *  `grep "safe" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db`

## Installing New Scripts
* We mentioned previously that the Nmap website contains a list of scripts, so, what happens if one of these is missing in the scripts directory locally?
* A standard `sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap` should fix this;
* However, it's also possible to install the scripts manually by downloading the script from Nmap:
 * `sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse`
*  This must then be followed up with `nmap --script-updatedb`, which updates the script.db file to contain the newly downloaded script.

# Firewall evasion
* Your typical Windows host will, with its default firewall, block all ICMP packets.
* This presents a problem: not only do we often use ping to manually establish the activity of a target, Nmap does the same thing by default. This means that Nmap will register a host with this firewall configuration as dead and not bother scanning it at all.
* So, we need a way to get around this configuration. Fortunately Nmap provides an option for this: -Pn, which tells Nmap to not bother pinging the host before scanning it.
* This means that Nmap will always treat the target host(s) as being alive, effectively bypassing the ICMP block;
* However, it comes at the price of potentially taking a very long time to complete the scan (if the host really is dead then Nmap will still be checking and double checking every specified port).
* The following switches are of particular note:
  * -f:- Used to fragment the packets (i.e. split them into smaller pieces) making it less likely that the packets will be detected by a firewall or IDS.
  * An alternative to -f, but providing more control over the size of the packets: --mtu <number>, accepts a maximum transmission unit size to use for the packets sent. This must be a multiple of 8.
  * --scan-delay <time>ms:- used to add a delay between packets sent. This is very useful if the network is unstable, but also for evading any time-based firewall/IDS triggers which may be in place.
  * --badsum:- this is used to generate in invalid checksum for packets. Any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet, however, firewalls may potentially respond automatically, without bothering to check the checksum of the packet. As such, this switch can be used to determine the presence of a firewall/IDS.
 
# Practical
* **ICMP ping request :
  * `ping [target]`
