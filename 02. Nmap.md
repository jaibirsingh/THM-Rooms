* Every computer has a total of 65535 available ports; however, many of these are registered as standard ports.
* For example, a HTTP Webservice can nearly always be found on port 80 of the server. A HTTPS Webservice can be found on port 443. Windows NETBIOS can be found on port 139 and SMB can be found on port 445.
*  only port numbers 0 to 1023 are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known ports.
*  What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats at once?
  * -oA

* How would you tell nmap to scan all ports?
  * -p-
 
*  Configure a firewall to respond with a RST TCP packet. For example, in IPtables for Linux, a simple version of the command would be as follows:

* `iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport <port> -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset`

* This can make it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to get an accurate reading of the target(s).

# Scan types
### TCP connect scans
* `-sT`
* ![image](https://github.com/jaibirsingh/THM-Rooms/assets/20526556/f7b51549-af8a-4a7f-b1f1-c56f9476d894)

**What are RFCs** 
 * In networking, RFCs are documents that describe various aspects of the internet, its protocols, technologies, and standards.
 * They are published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and serve as a means for individuals and groups to propose new standards, discuss protocols, or document best practices.

### SYN scans
* `-sS`
* SYN scans are sometimes referred to as "Half-open" scans, or "Stealth" scans.
* Where TCP scans perform a full three-way handshake with the target, SYN scans sends back a RST TCP packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from the server (this prevents the server from repeatedly trying to make the request).
* In other words, the sequence for scanning an open port looks like this:
* ![image](https://github.com/jaibirsingh/THM-Rooms/assets/20526556/c736b74f-facd-4646-9d95-72982ca4232a)
* All in all, the pros outweigh the cons.
* For this reason, SYN scans are the default scans used by Nmap if run with sudo permissions. If run without sudo permissions, Nmap defaults to the TCP Connect scan we saw in the previous task.

### UDP scans
* `sU`
* When a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response.
* The request is sent a second time as a double-check. If there is still no response then the port is marked open|filtered and Nmap moves on.
* When a packet is sent to a closed UDP port, the target should respond with an ICMP (ping) packet containing a message that the port is unreachable. This clearly identifies closed ports, which Nmap marks as such and moves on.
* UDP connection is slow, so scanning with  nmap -sU --top-ports 20 <target>. Will scan the top 20 most commonly used UDP ports, resulting in a much more acceptable scan time.

### Null scans
* `-sN`
*  the TCP request is sent with no flags set at all.
*  As per the RFC, the target host should respond with a RST if the port is closed.

### FIN scans
* `-sF`
* a request is sent with the FIN flag (usually used to gracefully close an active connection). Once again, Nmap expects a RST if the port is closed.
